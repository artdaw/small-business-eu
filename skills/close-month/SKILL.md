description: Closes the month — reconciles Exact Online vs payment processors, flags gaps, writes P&L narrative, exports close packet. Accepts optional month and save-to arguments.

Run the month-end close workflow. Reconcile, flag gaps, narrate the P&L, and export the close packet for the owner's records (and their accountant).

Parse arguments:
- `--month` (default: previous calendar month) — `YYYY-MM` format
- `--save-to` (default `files`) — `files` (Google Drive / OneDrive), `desktop` (local), or `both`

## Step 1 — Reconcile

Trigger the `month-end-prep` skill workflow:

1. Pull all Exact Online transactions for the target month (EUR).
2. Pull settlements from each connected payment processor (Mollie, PayPal, SumUp) for the same month.
3. Match Exact Online entries to processor settlements by amount + date (±2 days).
4. Surface three gap categories:
   - **Unmatched processor settlements** — money came in via Mollie/PayPal/SumUp but never landed in Exact Online
   - **Unmatched Exact Online deposits** — Exact shows income with no processor record (SEPA transfer? direct payment? misclassified?)
   - **Variance lines** — matched but amount differs (fees, refunds split)

## Step 2 — Flag suspicious entries

Surface in the same report:
- **Uncategorized transactions** — Exact Online entries with no ledger category
- **Suspicious duplicates** — same amount, same vendor, within 3 days
- **Missing receipts** — Exact Online entries above €75 with no attachment
- **VAT anomalies** — transactions with unexpected or missing VAT codes

For each, recommend an action. Wait for owner to triage flagged items before generating the narrative. Do not auto-categorize or auto-delete.

## Step 3 — P&L narrative

After triage, generate a plain-English P&L narrative:

```
{Month YYYY} closed at €{revenue} revenue ({+/-}{X}% vs prior month).
Top driver: {category/customer}. Biggest swing: {category} {direction} €{amount}
because {reason inferred from transactions}.

Margin: {X}% ({+/-}Y pts vs prior). {Cost-side commentary}.

VAT position: €{net VAT payable/reclaimable} for the month.

Three notable items:
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
```

Numbers come from Exact Online; the *why* comes from cross-referencing top transactions, vendor names, and prior-month deltas.

## Step 4 — Export the close packet

Generate two files:

1. **`close-packet-{YYYY-MM}.xlsx`** — multi-tab workbook:
   - `Reconciliation` — Exact Online ↔ processor match table with gap rows highlighted
   - `Flagged` — uncategorized / duplicates / missing receipts / VAT anomalies
   - `P&L` — formatted income statement in EUR with prior-month delta column
   - `VAT` — VAT summary: output tax, input tax, net position
2. **`close-packet-{YYYY-MM}.pdf`** — one-page summary: P&L narrative + top-line numbers + gap count

Save both to the chosen `--save-to` location. Filename format: `close-packet-2026-04.xlsx` etc.

## Connector failures

If Exact Online is unreachable, stop — reconciliation requires Exact Online as the source of truth. If a payment processor (Mollie, PayPal, SumUp) is unreachable, run reconciliation against the available processors and note which is missing. If all processors are missing, run Exact Online-only analysis and flag it.

## Approval gates

- **Never auto-fix flagged items.** Always show the gap, recommend an action, wait for the owner.
- **Never delete duplicates without explicit confirmation.** Show both records side-by-side.
- **Saving the packet is auto** — it goes to the owner's own drive.

## Output

End the run with a one-paragraph recap: revenue in EUR, margin, gap count remaining (if any), file paths to the saved packet.
