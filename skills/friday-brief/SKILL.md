Run the Friday wins-and-watches briefing. Pull the numbers, surface what matters, and give the owner a clean end-of-week picture.

Parse arguments:
- `--lookback` (default: `7d`) — `7d` for one week or `14d` for a two-week rolling comparison

## Step 1 — Revenue pulse

Using the `business-pulse` skill workflow:

1. Pull Mollie, PayPal, and SumUp settlements for the lookback period (EUR).
2. Pull Exact Online revenue for the same window if connected.
3. Pull any CRM deal closes (HubSpot, Pipedrive, or Brevo) for the same window.
4. Calculate week-over-week revenue delta (EUR).
5. Surface top 3 revenue sources (product / customer / channel) ranked by contribution.

## Step 2 — Sales breakdown

1. List the top 5 selling products/services by volume and revenue (EUR).
2. List the bottom 3 (anything that moved less than expected vs. prior period).
3. Flag any items with a sudden spike or drop (>20% change).

## Step 3 — Wins and watches summary

Format the output as:

```
Friday Brief — {date}

WINS
• {win 1}
• {win 2}
• {win 3}

WATCHES
• {watch 1} — {recommended action}
• {watch 2} — {recommended action}

Revenue this week: €{amount} ({+/-}X% vs last week)
```

## Connector failures

Run with whatever is connected — this command degrades gracefully. If payment processors (Mollie/PayPal/SumUp) are missing, skip transaction data and note it. If Exact Online is missing, use payment processor data only. If CRM is missing, skip deal closes and note it. If nothing is connected, stop and tell the owner: "No revenue sources connected. Connect Exact Online, Mollie, PayPal, or a CRM to run the Friday brief."

## Approval gates

- **Never send or post this brief automatically.** Always display it for the owner to review first.
- **Never auto-cancel or modify anything.** Surface the data and recommendations only.

## Output

End with the formatted brief (EUR) and ask the owner: "Want me to post this to Slack, email it to yourself, or save it?"
